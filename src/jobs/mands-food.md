Part of a small team developing an exciting new e-commerce venture for M&S.

I've used the Google Lighthouse tool to identify performance issues and consequently installed:

- React-Loadable to assist code splitting.
- Intersection observer to lazy render off-screen elements.
- FontFaceObserver to efficiently load fonts
- Web Worker to run a countdown timer accurately
