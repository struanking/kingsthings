Maintained UI for telephone consultant task management system.

As the principle front-end developer I worked with the team to introduce new features and update the front-end stack. I migrated the existing code to Redux Toolkit (reduce boilerplate, uses Immer), updated test framework to Testing Library.

Introduced Theme-UI and design tokens to improve the consistency of UI components. Added screenshot tests using Puppeteer to test for UI regressions during builds.

Updated Storybook to the latest version and introduced new features to improve the documentation.
