Technical lead and architect for front-end web development across a range of projects. Responsible for the research, selection and implementation of appropriate technical stack.

Introduced new technologies and techniques including React, Redux, React Router, Webpack (code splitting, compression, postcss) and ES6. Worked with server-side devs on NodeJS, API design and deployment to Amazon AWS & S3 buckets.

In addition to the technical overview I championed git workflow, test driven development and code reviews. I also mentored and assisted junior developers.
